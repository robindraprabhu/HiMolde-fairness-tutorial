This repo contains a lightly modified version of the tutorial ["An Intersectional Approach to Model Construction and Evaluation in Mental Health Care (Online)"](https://facctconference.org/2022/acceptedtuts#construct) by Marta Maslej (CAMH), Laura Sikstrom (CAMH), Darla Reslan (Toronto) and Yifan Wang (McMaster) given at ACT FAccT 2022.

The tutorial makes use of simulated data. Some of the categories in the original dataset have been remaped to more abstract categories. The modified dataset is entirely fictitious and the dataset should only be viewed as an illustrative artefact for the purposes of this tutorial.

This tutorial makes use of fairlearn-package (learn more on fairlearn.org). A detailed version of the tutorial can be found [here](https://fairlearn.org/v0.11/auto_examples/plot_intersectional_bias.html#sphx-glr-auto-examples-plot-intersectional-bias-py).
